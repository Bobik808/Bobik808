## Hey! Thanks for stopping by

#### I'm Koz, a fullstack software engineer on a mission to make the web that little bit more fun

To me nothing is more motivating than designing an immaginative solution to a problem and nothing is more rewarding than seeing it through to the end.
I am fiercely collaborative and a voracious consumer of music and coffee.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently making my web sequencer into a web based mini-DAW
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript and web animation with GSAP and Three.js
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Web Sockets and the Web Audio API

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm learning to play the Jew's harp
